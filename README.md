Timer Based Calculation Game in Android
This is a simple game; logic taken from a Udemy course on Android Development by Nick Walter (ZappyCode)
This works like:
  -A start button will be there on screen
  -When we click the start button, screen will display a simple addition problem and 
  -4 possible answers, a timer (It's been set to 10 seconds by default), and a score box
  -The user is allowed to click on the answer and if it is right, they will get 1 point
Modified a little bit.
